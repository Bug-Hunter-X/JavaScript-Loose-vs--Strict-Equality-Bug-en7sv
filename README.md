# JavaScript Loose vs. Strict Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to the misuse of loose equality (`==`) versus strict equality (`===`) operators, specifically when dealing with `null` values.

The `bug.js` file showcases the unexpected behavior that can arise from using loose equality in conditional statements. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct solution using strict equality to avoid the problem.  This bug can be subtle and difficult to debug, especially in larger codebases.

## Problem:

The core issue is the difference between how `==` and `===` handle null values and type coercion.  Loose equality (`==`) performs type coercion before comparison, while strict equality (`===`) does not.  This difference in behavior can result in unexpected results when checking for `null` or `undefined` values.

## Solution:

Always use strict equality (`===`) when comparing values.  This ensures that a comparison occurs only if both values have the same type and value, avoiding unintended type coercion that can lead to unexpected behavior.
